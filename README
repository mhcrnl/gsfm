ABOUT

gsfm is a simple Gtk+3 file manager for quick directory manipulation. User can
split the dirctory view vertically or horizontally, make basic oprations like
file/directory copying, deleting and opening, execute shell commands.

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS

The modifier key (MOD key in this documentation) is CTRL by default. You can
change this by editing the configuration. The default keyboard shortcuts are
similar of those in Vim, so Vim user should be familiar with them.

<Mod>+w   : next view
<Mod>+s   : split view vertically from the current view
<Mod>+d   : split view horizontally from the current view
<Mod>+l   : focus the location entry of the current view
j,k       : move down(j) and move up(k) in view
o         : open selected item
!         : execute command in terminal in current view path
/         : search in current view
<space>   : add/remove item to/from selection
y         : mark selection for copy
c         : mark selection for cut
d         : delete selection

NOTE: not all shortcuts are functional yet because of ongoing development.
